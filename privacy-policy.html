        <h1>Privacy Policy — BlockerMax</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Effective Date: 06.10.2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Nanegate (“Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses,
            discloses, and protects information when you use the BlockerMax mobile application (“App”).</p>
        <p>By accessing or using BlockerMax, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms of
            this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Policy applies to information collected through the BlockerMax App, related mobile services, and in-app
            purchases. It does not apply to information collected offline, through third-party websites, or other
            applications not controlled by the Company.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following categories of data, depending on your platform and permissions granted:</p>

        <h3>(a) Accessibility Permission (Android)</h3>
        <p>BlockerMax uses the Android Accessibility Service API solely to enforce app and website blocking based on
            your configuration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The service does not collect, transmit, or store screen content or any personally identifiable
                information (PII).</li>
            <li>All accessibility actions are processed locally on your device to provide core functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(b) Notification Access</h3>
        <p>The App may request permission to access notifications for the purpose of detecting app usage or identifying
            blocked app activity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notification data is processed locally only and is never shared with or transmitted to any server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>(c) Analytics and Crash Reporting</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics (services provided by Google LLC) to collect aggregated,
            anonymized usage statistics and crash reports.</p>
        <p>This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (model, OS version, country)</li>
            <li>General app interaction data</li>
            <li>Error diagnostics and performance data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No personal identifiers are collected or linked to this data.</p>

        <h3>(d) Subscription and Payment Data</h3>
        <p>We use RevenueCat, Inc. to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.</p>
        <p>RevenueCat may process limited metadata such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product identifiers</li>
            <li>Purchase status (active, expired, refunded)</li>
            <li>Anonymous user tokens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is handled in accordance with RevenueCat’s own privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>3. Platform Differences</h2>
        <p>Due to platform-specific permissions and restrictions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On Android devices, the App may utilize Accessibility and Notification permissions to enforce blocking
                functionality.</li>
            <li>On iOS devices, certain blocking and monitoring features may be limited due to system restrictions. The
                App only collects limited, Apple-permitted analytics and device data (model, OS version).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use the Data</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used strictly for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate and improve the functionality and performance of the App</li>
            <li>To diagnose and resolve technical issues</li>
            <li>To manage subscriptions and validate purchases</li>
            <li>To understand general user behavior in an aggregated and anonymized form</li>
            <li>To comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use the collected data for targeted advertising or user profiling.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessibility and notification data remain entirely on your device and are never transmitted externally.
            </li>
            <li>Analytics and diagnostic logs are securely stored on Firebase servers in accordance with Google’s
                security standards.</li>
            <li>Data transmission (where applicable) is protected using TLS/HTTPS encryption.</li>
            <li>Access to analytics and subscription data is limited to authorized personnel only.</li>
            <li>While we implement commercially reasonable measures to protect data, no system is completely secure. You
                are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your device credentials.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain anonymized analytics and diagnostic data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
            described in this Policy.</p>
        <p>You can delete locally processed data at any time by uninstalling the App.</p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>BlockerMax is designed for adults and parents and is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age.
        </p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
        <p>Parents may use BlockerMax to assist in managing their children’s screen time, but all setup and permissions
            must be performed by an adult.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to or deletion of your data</li>
            <li>Withdraw app permissions at any time via your device’s system settings</li>
            <li>Opt out of analytics tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell or share user data with third parties for advertising purposes.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>BlockerMax integrates only trusted, industry-standard third-party services:</p>
